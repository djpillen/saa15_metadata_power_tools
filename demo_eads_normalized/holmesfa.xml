<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>The Holmes family lived in turn-of-the century Bay City, Michigan. They were middle-class entrepreneurs in the lumber business, their social circle consisting of other mill and hardware business families. The mother, Emeline, widow of Mr. Henry (?) Holmes, had at least five children: Susie (Susan Ann); John called also Jack and married to Pauline; Wendell, a lumber dealer, married to Ruth Price; Daisy (possibly real name Lydia), a sister (name uncertain) married to Edward C. Hargrave, who was the son in E. J. Hargrave &amp; Son Lumber Mill, with possibly three children; and Harry Holmes who may have been a brother of Henry Holmes.</p>
</bioghist>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The Holmes papers, dating ca. 1883 to 1957, have been divided into four major series: Susie Holmes Papers, Harry Holmes Papers, Other Holmes Papers, and Miscellaneous. For the most part, the Holmes Family collection documents events and concerns of a middle-class family running a family business and socializing with other middle-class business families. The family enjoyed good hotels when they traveled, they worried about profits and losses, and they commented occasionally on national events of the times. But in sum, their work ethic, comments about life and death in general, and concern for family and friends are the themes that distinguish this collection of family letters.</p>

<p>The bulk of the papers consists of letters from the family to Susie Holmes. From 1897 to 1903, Susie was living near, and working in, Buffalo New York for Charles G. Butts. In addition to family correspondence, business correspondence from her boss, and personal business material such as her insurance notices, the Susie Holmes series includes church activity announcements, a few wedding invitations, a batch of 3 x 5 cards with English and American literary references, and letters to and from other members of her family which were subsequently forwarded on to Susie.</p>

<scopecontent><p>The letters to Susie Holmes refer to family and friends, their ailments, travels, moving experiences, comments about the family business, and acknowledgment of gifts received during the holidays. Susie, it would appear, was the only member of the family, with the possible exception of a sibling in Georgia, not living in the Bay City area. Though there is no indication Susie was escaping from an affair of the heart or that she was an early advocate of women's economic rights, she was fairly young, unmarried, and living far from home. The many letters, often dated one day right after the other, indicate a voluminous correspondence between Susie and her family. The series of her business correspondence also indicates that she had a very cordial relationship with her boss and her boss's mother or wife. Susie also received "letters" from a few of her young nieces and nephews. She traveled occasionally to see family members either for brief vacation time or for business, and was trusted enough by her boss, Charles G. Butts, to receive letters from him with instructions to act upon information he was sending her or to look up information for him. </p></scopecontent>
