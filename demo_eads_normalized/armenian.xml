<p>The Armenian Studies Program at the University of Michigan began in 1976 with the introduction of courses in Armenian language and history.  In 1981, the Alex Manoogian Chair in Modern Armenian History was established.  A second chair, the Marie Manoogian Chair in Armenian Language and Literature, was established in 1987.  Both chairs were funded the Alex and Marie Manoogian Foundation. </p>
<p>The Armenian Studies Program features a vigorous outreach program to involve Armenians of Southeastern Michigan and the Midwest in its educational activities, periodic lectures, and films.  The program publishes a yearly newsletter, develops cultural programs and the Summer Language Institute, an intensive six-week course on Armenian language held at Yerevan State University in Armenia.  Courses focus on Armenian language, history, architecture, literature, and intellectual history.  The Armenian Studies Program is affiliated with the International Institute and involves faculty from several different departments, centers, and programs across campus.  </p>
<p>As of September 2003, current information on the Armenian Studies Program can be found on the Web at the following URL:  http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/asp/</p>
