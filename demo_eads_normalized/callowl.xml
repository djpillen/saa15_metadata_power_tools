<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><p>Laura Carter Callow (1927-    ) was an activist during the 1970s and 80s who worked for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment on both the state and the national levels.  A part-time art teacher with three children, she earned a bachelor's degree from Wayne State University.  Callow was an acting officer in several women's rights organizations, and recorded a monthly spot on the "Point of View" radio program out of Detroit for almost ten years (1977 to 1986), speaking about various issues related to the ERA.  Helen Milliken, whose husband was the governor of Michigan from 1969 through 1982, referred to her in a letter as "the Susan B. Anthony of Michigan."</p>
<p>Callow, elected president of Livonia's League of Women Voters in 1968, began her activities in the women's movement in earnest in 1972 because of discriminatory credit policies, and helped to found the Northwest Wayne County chapter of the National Organization for Women.  She then became involved in Title IX (equal opportunity to women in federally-funded academic institutions) compliance issues, and later the ERA, of which she has said "ERA is about money, because most of the discrimination against women involves money."  In addition to the "Point of View" broadcasts, Callow spoke at numerous conferences, meetings and classes (at high schools as well as at the University of Michigan's Law School and School of Social Work) in favor of the ERA.</p>
<p>Callow was sent as a delegate of the League of Women Voters in 1975 to a new coalition called W.O.M.E.N. (Women Organized to Meet Existing Needs), which brought together such state women's rights organizations as the American Association of University Women, the National Organization for Women, and the Republican Women's Caucus.  She was elected secretary.  In 1976, many of these same organizations, as well as W.O.M.E.N. itself and Kellogg's of Battle Creek, United Auto Workers, and Negro Business and Professional Women, joined another coalition, Michigan ERAmerica.  The coalition concentrated its efforts on effecting the ratification of the ERA.  Although Michigan ratified the Amendment in 1972, Michigan ERAmerica helped to keep enthusiasm up in the state, as well as to raise money for distribution to other organizations in the thirteen states that never ratified.  Callow served ERAmerica as co-chair throughout the extensions granted these states and beyond; ERAmerica sent out newsletters as late as 1990.</p>
<p>Callow won much recognition for her efforts on behalf of the ERA and other women's issues, including receiving the Alice Paul Award from the Metropolitan Detroit area chapters of NOW, and being appointed a delegate to the Regional White House Conference on Families in 1980.  She continued her correspondence with her fellow activists, including Helen Milliken and Martha Griffiths (honorary co-chairs of ERAmerica) and Elly Peterson.</p></bioghist>
