<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>Dr. Arthur Whitmore Smith was born in Hartford, Vermont on May 11, 1874.  After receiving his B.S. degree in 1893 from the University of New Hampshire, he continued his education at Wesleyan University, receiving a Masters of Science in 1895.  Dr. Smith completed his Ph.D. in physics at Johns Hopkins University in 1903.</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Dr. Smith held numerous teaching assignments including positions at Wesleyan University and the University of Mississippi.  In 1903, he came to the University of Michigan where he taught in the physics department until his retirement in 1944.  During his forty-one years at the University of Michigan, Dr. Smith wrote numerous articles.  His special area of study concerned the calorimetric determination of the energy of food.</p>

<p>Dr. Smith's hobby was genealogy which he pursued throughout his life.  He was involved with many organizations dealing with genealogical research.  For example, he served as both vice-president and president of the Michigan Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.  Furthermore, Dr. Smith helped found an Ann Arbor chapter of  the Institute of American Genealogy.</p>

<p>Dr. Smith remained active as a professor until his death on December 1, 1954.</p>
