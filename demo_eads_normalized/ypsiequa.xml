<abstract>
The Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality (YCFE) organization was formed in about 2001 to contest a ballot proposal that would have removed sexual orientation protections from the Ypsilanti City Charter.  This record group comprises the material they amassed during their campaign; it includes budgets, planning documents, literature, and press coverage.

<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>In 1998, Ypsilanti voters passed a Human Rights Ordinance that prohibited discrimination based on several characteristics, including sexual orientation.  In 2001 a petition was circulated to amend the city charter and remove these protections; enough signatures were gathered for a proposal to be added to the ballot in the next city election.  Unlawful activities were suspected to have taken place as signatures were gathered and a lawsuit was brought by the Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality and Elizabeth Warren against the Ypsilanti City Clerk (among others) for validating the petition.  </p>

<p>Despite the lawsuit the measure remained on the ballot.  YCFE campaigned against it by organizing volunteers, educating voters and conducting fundraisers.  Their campaign was successful and the ballot measure was defeated in the 2002 city election.</p>
