<abstract>
The University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) was established in 1909 as a teaching and research facility located in the tip of the lower peninsula of Michigan.  It preserves several habitats for study.  The main areas of research are field biology and ecology.  The records of the UMBS focus on evaluations of the program, research, and educational programs.

<p>The University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) was established in 1909 and is part of the College of Literature, Science and Arts.  It is located on the tip of the lower peninsula of Michigan, on the shores of Douglas Lake.  The UMBS encompasses many habitats, including several vegetation zones, bogs, marshes, swamps, fens, beach pools, natural undeveloped lake shoreline, lakes, and two creek watersheds.  It was established to protect the land for current and future research.</p>

<p>The UMBS is both a teaching and research facility.  It was established for summer research only but expanded to operate all year in the early 1970s to allow for more thorough study of the ecosystems.  Undergraduate and graduate students attend seminars, classes, and conduct independent studies to learn how to conduct research.  Professionals come to the UMBS to conduct research, and to teach.  There are research facilities, teaching laboratories and classrooms, a library, and living facilities.</p>

<p>The research at UMBS is focused on field biology and ecology.  Researchers seek to understand the habitats and ecosystems located within the UMBS.  It provides a good location for studying lake, stream, and forest ecology.  Other areas of research have included the physiological ecology of plants and animals, systematics, limnology, biological indicators of environmental change, and land use and management.</p>

<p>More current information is available at the UMBS website:  http://www.umich.edu/~umbs </p>

<p>The records of the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) include materials used to evaluate the benefit of continuing the program during a university budget crisis in the early 1980s, and materials focused more generally on the research and educational programs of the UMBS.  The records are divided into four subseries:  Administrative, Review, Research, and Education Programs.</p>

<p>The series Education Programs consists of two programs:  the Groundwater Education in Michigan program (GEM) and the Naturalist-Ecologist Training Program (NETP).  GEM promotes the maintenance of water quality and includes a center located at UMBS with literature pertaining to groundwater for the education of communities, and a classroom component to teach about water quality.  NETP is a training program for students located at the UMBS, which allows students to work with established ecologists and develop their knowledge and research skills.  The 1983 NETP report to the Mellon foundation includes ten black and white, 5x7 inch photographs attached to the back pages of the report.  Nine are of students conducting research and one is a group photograph.  The photograph on page 36 is missing.  </p>
