<p>The bulk of the collection consists of the University Committees series (0.9 linear feet, 1989-1997).  The papers include meeting minutes, memos and correspondence between committee members, drafts of reports, and Jensen's notes.  Three committees are represented in this collection.  The Organizational Task Force was charged with examining the structure of the university and suggesting improvements.  The Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA) is the executive branch of faculty government.  Most of the papers concern this committee.  The Task Force on the Arts and Undergraduate Education worked to find ways to integrate the arts into undergraduate education.  </p></scopecontent>
