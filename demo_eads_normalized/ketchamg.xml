<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>Jean Miriam Seeley and Gilbert Newberry Ketcham were born in Pontiac, Michigan in 1920.  They both graduated from Pontiac High School in 1938 and attended Michigan State College.  They married in 1941 and Ketcham joined the army in 1942 following his graduation.  Seeley also graduated from Michigan State College with a degree in journalism and home economics.  After graduating, she took a job as a foods editor with the <title render="italic">Chicago Tribune</title> and wrote under the name "Mary Starr."</p>

<p>Ketcham served as a member of the 433rd Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Battalion, and was among the troops that invaded North Africa at the end of 1942.  He was also present for Patton's apology after he struck a shell-shocked solider and served as a member in the Guard of Honor for the Sultan of Morocco.  Following its service in North Africa, the 433rd participated in the Italian Campaign and the drive on Rome.</p>

<p>Ketcham returned to the United States in April of 1944 and Seeley quit her job at the <title render="italic">Chicago Tribune</title>.  After asking an officer at the Pentagon to be assigned stateside duty, Ketcham was stationed at Camp McQuade near Capitola, California.  His unit was responsible for ensuring that prisoners who went A.W.O.L. sailed on a ship to the Pacific Theater.</p>

<p>Ketcham left the Army in December of 1945 and returned with his wife to Pontiac.  They had three children.  Ketcham died in 2003.</p>
