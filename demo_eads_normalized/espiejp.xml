<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>John Paxton Espie was born on February 14, 1881 on a farm in Moscow township of Hillsdale County, Michigan which his grandparents had settled in 1836.  He attended Hanover High School and was a graduate of the Armstrong Business College of Hillsdale.  In 1909, Espie settled on a farm located in Eagle Township, Clinton County, where he remained until his death in 1949.</p>

<p>Espie was elected supervisor of Eagle Township and continued in that capacity until 1929.  Espie, a Republican, was first elected to the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1922, where he eventually served thirteen terms and died in office.  From 1939 to 1949 he served as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He also served on a number of state commissions and received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan in June 1948.</p>

<p>In addition to operating his farm, Espie was Director of the Mutual Insurance Company as well as of the Grand Ledge Produce Company.  He was a member of the Episcopal Church and was active in the Masonic and Independent Order of Odd Fellows (I.O.O.F.) fraternities. He was married to Edith H. Sprague in 1904 and had three sons.  Edith Espie died in 1932.  Espie's youngest son, Charles, was killed in action during World War II.  John Espie died on December 2, 1949.</p>

Of more value seem to be John Espie's diaries covering a seven-year period from 1942-to 1949.  Unfortunately, however, Espie often let long periods of time elapse without making any entries in his diaries.  A number of photographs--usually group photographs within which John Espie is normally included--are contained in this collection.  Some of these photographs are identified.</p></scopecontent>
