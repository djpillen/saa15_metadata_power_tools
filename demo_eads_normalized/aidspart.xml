<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>AIDS Partnership Michigan is a Detroit-based organization focused on providing education about HIV and AIDS and services for those who are infected, or affected, by HIV/AIDS.  They manage a hotline, both by phone and on the Internet, provide transportation and hot meals to patients, and run three test sites for HIV.  They also provide counseling and referrals to community services for HIV/AIDS patients and distribute brochures and condoms.  The majority of their funding is from federal grants, as well as through fund-raisers and donations.  They have approximately 30 staff and over a hundred volunteers, and are governed by a board of directors.</p>
<p>AIDS Partnership Michigan was founded on April 1, 1996.  It is the result of a merger between Wellness Networks, Inc. and AIDS Care Connection.  Wellness Networks, Inc. was established in 1983 to deal with the emerging AIDS problem in the Detroit/Metro area.  Their purpose was to provide education and services to help prevent the spread of AIDS and refer patients to social services.  AIDS Care Connection was founded in 1989 to coordinate services for individuals affected by HIV.</p>

(2.75 linear feet, 1983-1996) documents one of the two organizations that merged in 1996 to become AIDS Partnership Michigan.  The majority of the papers are meeting minutes from the Board of Directors and Executive Committee, as well as some subcommittees.  In addition to minutes, the meeting materials include correspondence, financial reports, articles, and statistics on the hotline callers.  The meetings are arranged chronologically, subdivided by each meeting.  After 1987, there are fewer papers for each meeting.  The series also includes a few financial reports and pamphlets produced by the Wellness Network to educate the public about AIDS.</p></scopecontent>
