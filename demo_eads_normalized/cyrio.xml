<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>On February 27, 1961 University of Michigan President Harlan Hatcher appointed an eight member commission "to consider possible plans for integrated year-round operation and to recommend to him that program which would be best suited to the present and future needs of the University." ( <title render="italic">Box 1, folder: Final Report</title> )</p>
<p>The commission examined three basic questions:  1.) Was a basic change to the University's academic routine justified and desirable?  2.) What alternative arrangements provided year-round integrated operation while maintaining the standards of the university?  3.) What arrangements should be recommended to the President and the Regents?</p>
<p>The work of the Commission on Year-Round Integrated Operation (CYRIO) was very much a continuation of several earlier calendar committees.  Among its predecessors was the University Calendar Study Committee, chaired by Professor Paul S. Dwyer of the Mathematics department, which reported its findings June 19, 1958.  Appointed by President Hatcher on January 9, 1958, this five member committee had as its major goal "making recommendations for a university calendar suited to the times." (<title render="italic">Box 1, folder: Final Report, June 19, 1958</title>)  The committee made many recommendations regarding all facets of the university calendar, from the scheduling of new student orientation to the scheduling of commencement.  According to the CYRIO report, the Dwyer Report was "a major guide to other colleges and universities in their deliberations."</p>
<p>Based on its research, the CYRIO recommended that year-round operation was necessary and desirable.</p>
