<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>Zonta is a Sioux Indian word meaning "to band together for a purpose."  The creators of Zonta International, a service organization of executive women in business and other professions, wanted the organization to represent such values as honesty, trust and inspiration.  Zonta members believe by embracing in friendships and joining efforts and talents with others who are like-minded, they enrich their personal and professional lives.  Through club meetings, inter-city functions, work shops, district conferences and international conferences, they also work to improve the status of women throughout the world.  The Zonta Club of Ann Arbor, a chapter of Zonta International, was organized by members of the Detroit chapter on March 28, 1924 and was chartered on May 16, 1924 with fifteen members.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The records of the Zonta Club of Ann Arbor cover the period 1972 to 1990, though the bulk of the materials date since 1987.  The record group largely concerns the official functions of the Club and the various events that it sponsored.  The folders in the record group are arranged alphabetically, with the contents of folders either arranged chronologically or alphabetically.</p>

<p>The folders labeled Administrative, Board Meeting Agenda, Business and Social Meetings, and Treasurer's Reports contain organizational records of the club.  Included with these files are such items as the president's conference report, the proposed budget for operations, the report of pledges and contributions, various committee reports, committee announcements, officers reports, and financial credits and disbursements.  The Correspondence folder constitutes the largest portion of the collection.  Included is correspondence with the Zonta International Headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, with the state (District XV) office, and with other clubs in the area (Area III).  Also included is correspondence with other service organizations that Zonta of Ann Arbor financially endorsed or worked with in charity functions.</p>

<p>The Published Meetings file contains a set of booklets which are produced annually with the following topics in each booklet: the Zonta Blessing, Zonta Code, Clubwomens Collect written by Mary Stewart, listing of former Club Presidents, Officers Board Members, Committees, yearly calendar, and roster of members.  The Social and Educational file contains notices of upcoming charity, social events, educational seminars and regional and national conferences of Zonta International.  </p>
