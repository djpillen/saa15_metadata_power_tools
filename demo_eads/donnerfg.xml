<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><p>Frederic G. Donner was born October 4, 1902 in Three Oaks, Michigan.  He was educated at the University of Michigan, where in 1923 he received his bachelor of arts degree majoring in economics.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Mr. Donner went to work for the Chicago accounting firm of Reckitt, Benington and LeClear.  Then, in March 1926, he became an accountant with the Financial Staff of the General Motors Corporation in New York, and thus began his fifty-year career with the largest of the automobile companies.  Mr. Donner's advancement within General Motors was steady and noteworthy.  In 1934, he was elected assistant treasurer, and in 1937, he was made general assistant treasurer.  In 1941, he was elected vice president in charge of the Financial Staff.  On this same date, he was also appointed to the Administration Committee, and on January 5, 1942, he was made a member of the Board of Directors.  On April 2, 1956, Mr. Donner was made executive vice president and chairman of the Financial Policy Committee.  On September 1, 1958, he was appointed chairman of the board and chief executive officer of General Motors, positions which he held until November 1, 1967.  In his retirement, until May 1974, Mr. Donner continued to serve as member of the GM Board of Directors and of the company's Finance Commitee.</p>
<p>During his career at GM, Mr. Donner was involved in many and varied company programs.  During the 1930s, he participated in studies designed to improve dealer relations policies.  Subsequently, he involved himself in marketing practice and policy.  During World War II, he supervised the preparation of reports to the Price Adjustment Board of the U.S. War Department; while after the war, he concerned himself with problems of reconversion, modernization, and expansion.  In 1955, he initiated the Savings-Stock Purchase Program for Salaried Employees.  This program was but one reflection of Mr. Donner's interest in the planning and development of employee benefit and protection plans, and in labor relations in general.</p>
<p>Frederic Donner was twice honored by the University of Michigan, receiving an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1961, and a business leadership award from the School of Business Administration in 1967.  Frederic G. Donner died in 1987.</p></bioghist>
