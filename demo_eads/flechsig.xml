    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Jack Flechsig was born May 30, 1922 in Detroit to Helen and Otto Flechsig. He attended Wayne State University and was a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces during WWII and served as a navigator flying in 52 missions. Flechsig was a member of the Directors Guild of America and the Theatre Department at Wayne State University.  He was also a lifelong Puppeteer and a member of the Puppeteers of America. On January 15, 1949, he married Constance McBrearty, to whom he was married for 62 years, giving them 8 children and 11 grandchildren. Flechsig spent his professional career as an Emmy Award winning (1980s) Art Director for WXYZ-TV Channel 7, beginning in 1948 when the station first began broadcasting. He retired 39 years later in January of 1988. Flechsig died January 17, 2011 in Bloomfield Twp. at the age of 88.</p>
      <p>WXYZ-TV is an ABC affiliated station and the third of ABC's five original owned and operated TV stations (after New York and Chicago). The station was created out of the ABC-owned radio station WXYZ (1270 AM). The station originally began broadcasting in 1948 from studios located in the Maccabees Building in downtown Detroit. In 1959, broadcast facilities moved to Southfield, Mich. The station began broadcasting in color in 1964. By 1978, WXYZ-TV was the second most-dominant TV station in the U.S. in terms of local viewership. It remains a major television station in Detroit.</p>

The majority of this collection covers his time working at the station; however, part of the collection contains papers of the families of Flechsig and his wife, Constance. The collection is divided into two series: the Personal series and the Business series.</p>

          <p>The Business series (1 linear foot, 1950-1988) consists of items related to Flechsig's time at WXYZ-TV as the Art Director. This series provides insight into program advertising, television set design, as well as the work environment of WXYZ-TV. Some items of interest include a wide variety of Flechsig's designs, detailed lists of television rates and research as well as programming schedules, and many photographs from on set at the station (one photograph of President Nixon on the WXYZ-TV set is of note).</p>
