<c01 level="series"><did><unittitle>Collegiate Sorosis</unittitle></did>
<scopecontent><p>Collegiate Sorosis series mainly consists of photographs ranging from its founding to 1972. An undated photo album with a collection of photographs that may have been taken in the early 1900s. Many of the photographs within the series are labeled with names and dates. Sorosis records include correspondence, training materials, histories of the organization, constitution and by-laws, and notes. Business records include invoices, deeds, account books, construction plans and blueprints for the sorority's home (Collegiate Sorosis is reportedly the first sorority to build and have its own home). Correspondence includes letters written by two of the charter members that announce their resignation from their old sororities. The series also includes correspondence from the New York Sorosis chapter, who served as inspiration to the founders. There are 7 member directories, some of which contain short biographies of the alumni. The outsize box contains more photographs of Collegiate Sorosis and one photograph of the University of Michigan Engineering Class of 1917 (of which her father was a member).</p>
