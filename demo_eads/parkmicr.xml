<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>John G. Parkhurst was born April 17, 1824 at Oneida Castle, New York. He attended Oneida Academy, then studied law in the office of N. F. Graves.  He was admitted to the bar in 1847.  He moved to Coldwater, Michigan in 1849 and open up a law practice. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Governor Blair appointed Parkhurst to be lieutenant colonel of the 9th Michigan Infantry. He  was taken prisoner at Murfreesboro in July 1862, spent three months in a Southern prison, and was exchanged in December 1862. He served as lieutenant colonel and colonel in the 9th Michigan Infantry, provost marshal of the 14th Army Corps and of the Military District of Tennessee, and was brevet brigadier general of U. S. Volunteers. He served under General George H. Thomas.</p>

<p>From 1866 to 1869 he was marshal of the Michigan District.  A life-long Democrat ran for various offices, usually without success.  President Cleveland rewarded his service to his party and to the nation, naming Parkhurst as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to Belgium. He served from 1888 to 1889. In 1893, President Cleveland commissioned him postmaster of Coldwater where he served until 1897.</p>

<p>Parkhurst had many other interests.  As early as 1849, he was engaged in the insurance business which he continued throughout his life. He also invested in farm lands and participated in veterans organizations. He died May 6, 1906.</p>

<c01 level="series"><did><unittitle>Parkhurst Civil War Papers (Bentley Historical Library)</unittitle></did> <scopecontent><p>From 1861 to 1866, Parkhurst wrote one hundred and five letters to his sisters and to his young daughter. In these letters, he describes Fort Wayne and the steamer Mississippi; also the camp at West Point, Ky., with a drawing of the streets of tents and of his tent in particular. He writes of sickness in camp, his duties, marches, guerrillas, Vallandigham's crossing, and skirmishes with Morgan. He tells about the crops, the flies, and spring floods. He describes the beauties of the countryside, the conditions of the roads and the supply lines, and the fighting around Murfreesboro, Chattanooga and at Chickamauga, and the siege of Atlanta, with a special account of the battle of Stones River. He also tells of the forming of the 23rd Brigade, the exchange of prisoners, and mustering out. There are comments on General Thomas and a great many on his own family and personal affairs. Associated with these letters are the several files of other Civil War documents that he preserved, his recollection of the Battle of Stones River, and his involvement with veterans groups. The microfilm of these papers is available for inter-library loan.</p></scopecontent>
