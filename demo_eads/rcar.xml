<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>The Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights (RCAR) is a national organization of religious groups which is devoted to safeguarding access to legal abortion. RCAR was formed by leaders from 31 predominantly Protestant and Jewish groups in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion. The Michigan chapter of RCAR was established in June 1975, and members include organizations as well as individual clergy and laypeople. RCAR supports women's right to choose abortion as an expression of religious freedom.  The group believes that it is a violation of women's freedom of religion for the state to impose restrictions on their ability to follow their own conscience and faith regarding abortion. In addition to actively promoting separation of church and state, and freedom of reproductive choice, RCAR encourages sex education and family planning.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, members of Michigan RCAR have published newsletters and legislative updates, lobbied in Lansing and Washington, and organized letter writing campaigns, rallies, conferences, and other pro-choice events. The group is a non-profit organization which is run by an Executive Director and Policy Council consisting of representatives from a variety of religious groups. Michigan RCAR relies on donations and the efforts of volunteers to accomplish its goals.</p>
