<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>Irene Linda Lather Butler was born on July 8, 1901 in Traverse City, Michigan.  Active in many areas, she was both a registered nurse and an artist of some fame.  After completing high school, Irene Lather in September 1919 completed a three-year course of study at the Blodgett School of Nursing at Blodgett Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  She continued her education, completing a specialized course in obstetrics on June 20, 1923 at Dr. Joseph B Delee's Lying-In-Hospital.  After this four-month course, she received a diploma and a gold pin with a diamond, certifying that she had completed the course and could deliver babies if necessary.</p>

<p>Irene Linda Lather married William Butler on March 15, 1924 in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  When her husband became the head of the Department of Urology at the Grand Rapids Clinic in 1925, Irene Butler worked for him as his nurse and secretary.  In 1931 she joined the Women's Auxiliary to the Kent County Medical Society.  She was appointed membership chairman for 1935-36 and was elected president in 1938.  Also active in the Michigan State Medical Society, she was elected exhibition chairman in 1938 and in 1939 she was elected treasurer and in 1941 president.</p>

<p>Irene Butler was also an artist whose work has been exhibited in various prominent galleries in Grand Rapids and Arizona.  In 1933, she first began studying painting and sculpture at the Grand Rapids Art Gallery.  In 1956 she was honored with a one-person show of her work at the Gallery.  Wood and stone sculptures of hers were displayed, as well as paintings.  When she and her husband retired to Tucson, Arizona, she devoted her time to artistic endeavors.  Irene Linda Lather Butler died December 23, 1991 at the age of 90.</p>
