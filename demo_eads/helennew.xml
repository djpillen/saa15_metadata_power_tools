<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>The Helen Handy Newberry Residence was one of the first residence halls to be built on the University of Michigan campus.  The hall was built to house women students and continues to be used for this purpose.  In the summer of 1913, Truman Handy Newberry, John Stought Newberry, and Helen Newberry Joy contributed approximately $75,000 to the Student Christian Association to erect a women's dormitory in memory of their mother Helen Handy Newberry.  The residence was designed by the firm of Kahn and Wilby of Detroit and built by C. H. Christman of Lansing.  It is a four story semi-fireproof building with a white stucco exterior.  Under the provisions of the bequest, the residence was to be owned by the Student Christian Association, but built and administered by the university.  In 1924, the university purchased the building from the Student Christian Association.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520"><p>
This small 0.5 linear feet collection contains administrative records from the early years of Newberry Hall, 1915-1947.  The first folder contains the minutes of the Board of Governors for the years, 1915 to 1925.  The board was made up of five women.  These women included the Dean of Women and at least two women who were University of Michigan graduates or who had been students.  This board was appointed by the regents from those nominated by the Board of Trustees of the Students Christian Association.  The second folder includes brief historical and financial records.  These records give a brief financial history of the opening of the residence hall.  This includes an interesting discussion of the separate roles of the university and the Student Christian Association in the upkeep of the building.  There is a folder of budget summaries and a folder containing audits performed between 1927 and 1931.  The Food Services records include the number of meals served and an example of the cost for guest meals. The last folder is the architectural contract from Kahn and Wilby for alterations to Newberry Hall
