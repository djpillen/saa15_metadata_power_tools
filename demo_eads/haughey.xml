His wife Edith Cowles attended the U-M from 1902 to 1904 but left to marry and raise a family.  Together they had eight children: six sons and two daughters.  All eight either attended or graduated from the University of Michigan.  These were Edith (1931), Esther (1934-1937), Wilfrid Jr. (1935), Phillip (1937 arch.) Clifton (1936 eng.), Charles (1943 eng.), David (1940) and Louis (1940-1943 eng.).</p>
<p>The father Wilfrid H. Haughey was a Battle Creek ear, nose, and throat specialist.  He was also a leader within his profession serving as president and secretary of the Calhoun County Medical Society, also secretary and president of the Southern Michigan Triological Association.
