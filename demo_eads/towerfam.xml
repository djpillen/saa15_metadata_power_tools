<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>The Tower family members were earlier settlers to Ionia, Michigan. The patriarch of the family was Osmond Tower. His sons Osmond S. Tower and Angelo E. Tower were active in the business life of Ionia. Both sons served as captains with Company E, Sixth Michigan Cavalry during the Civil War. After the war, Angelo continued with his business interests. He was most involved in lumber and other investments, first in Ionia, later in the western United States, particularly Washington State, Tacoma area. Osmond was involved in banking and various commercial investments, notably as a stockholder and officer in the First National Bank of Ionia (later State Savings Bank).</p>

<p>Other individuals represented in the papers are Louis Lovett, who was vice president of the First National Bank, and who, in addition, had a lively interest in lumber investments and financial loans. Another family member, W. B. Heath, was cashier at the bank. Also represented in the collection is George W. Webber, who was a lumber dealer and general merchant in Ionia. He also served a term in Congress (1881-1882), and was president of the Second National Bank of Ionia.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The collection was accumulated and donated by Ada Health Owsley, the daughter of W.B. Heath, who had himself married into the Tower family. Most of the collection relates to the business dealings of Tower family members. The most important exception is a portion of the correspondence dealing with the Civil War service of Angelo Tower, a captain with Company E, Sixth Michigan Cavalry. These papers include both letters to his family and other documents relating to his military responsibilities. The collection, both correspondence and financial records, documents the development and commercial growth of Ionia, Michigan, and includes various records of Louis S. Lovell, bank cashier W.B. Heath, and George W. Webber, president of the Second National Bank of Ionia. The fact that there are some papers of George W. Webber, a banking competitor to the Towers is curious. Perhaps a possible merger of the two Ionia banks led to the storage of retired records in a common area. Regardless, the banking records of Tower and Webber offer some insight into the commercial development of Ionia.</p>
