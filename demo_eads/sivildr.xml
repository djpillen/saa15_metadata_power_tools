<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><p>Daniel Ross Sivil was born in Detroit, Michigan on June 25, 1940. He played an important role in the gay and lesbian civil rights and advocacy movement of the 1980s in Detroit, the state of Michigan, and nationally through his work in local and national gay rights organizations. Mr. Sivil was a founding member of the Michigan Organization for Human Rights in 1977. He also served three terms (1979-1982) as President of the Association of Suburban People (Plymouth, Michigan), a gay and lesbian organization devoted to social and political activity, as well as emotional support for that community. Mr. Sivil was also active with the Motor City Business Forum, the Detroit Area Gay and Lesbian Coalition, the American Association for Personal Privacy (Princeton, New Jersey), the Palmer Clinic (Ferndale, Michigan), the Virginia Gay Alliance (Arlington, Virginia), and the Gay Employment Protection Project (Washington, D.C.). He served as Chair of the Executive Committee on the Sexual Orientation Sub-Committee Family and Sexuality Task Force formed by the Civil Rights Committee of the Michigan House of Representatives (1981). He also served on the board of advisors of The Privacy Commission in 1982 (Sacramento, California). He has given public testimony in defense of gay and lesbian rights legislation to the Privacy Commission (1983), the City of Alexandria (Va.) Human Rights Commission (1985), and the Alexandria City Council (1987). Daniel Ross Sivil died in 1995 and is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit.</p></bioghist>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520"><p>The papers of Daniel Ross Sivil provide insight into the gay and lesbian civil rights and advocacy movement of the early 1980s on both a personal and professional level. Sivil's writings and correspondence with peers demonstrates the joys and difficulties of presiding over a grassroots gay and lesbian organization (including fundraising, attracting members, and competing with similar organizations) and lobbying for gay rights in general. The papers have been divided into three series; Activities, Correspondence, and Photographs.</p></scopecontent>

Folders of interest may include the correspondence to and from Henry D. Messer, M.D. This material relates the troubles of the Michigan Organization for Human Rights in the late 1980s. Mr. Sivil had left the organization at this point and moved to Virginia, but Dr. Messer was still involved with the organization and openly worried about its future in his communications with Mr. Sivil. Dr. Messer went on to become a founding member of the Triangle Foundation. Information about Mr. Sivil's personal life may be gleaned from his correspondence with Joseph M. Zendell with whom he had an intimate relationship. The complexities and eventual break-up of the relationship are well-documented in letters between the two.</p></scopecontent>
