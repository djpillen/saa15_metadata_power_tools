<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>The Amaranth Club of Jackson, Michigan was established in October 1897 and was the second women's Catholic literary club in Michigan; the first was the Catholic Woman's Study Club of Detroit.  The Amaranth Club was the first Catholic Literary Club to join the State Federation of Clubs in 1904.</p>

<p>The Amaranth Club was founded by Mrs. James Falihee who thought that there should be a Catholic literary club in Jackson in addition to the other literary clubs that already existed.  The first year, 1897-98, the Amaranth Club numbered 23 members.  At its founding the object of the Amaranth Club was "mutual improvement," and this object has been in the bylaws to the present.  The women of the club presented their own programs, book reviews, readings, plays, debates, skits and musical presentations often having to do with current events and topics.  The Amaranth Club met weekly from October through April.</p>

<p>The Amaranth Club was primarily a literary club, not a charity club.  However, throughout the years it donated much of its time and effort to charitable causes, especially during the depression and war years.  A Student Loan Fund was established in the late 1920s.</p>

There are also newspaper clippings and other miscellaneous items in the bound meeting minutes.  The minutes give a detailed account of each meeting, describing not only the topic of the meeting but also sometimes what people wore and ate.  The minutes are complete except for the years 1897-1920, 1937-1939, and 1955-1959. At the end of this series is a list of members from 1966-1980 that was found at the end of the loose, unbound minutes.</p></scopecontent>
