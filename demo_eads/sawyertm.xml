<bioghist encodinganalog="545">
<p>Thomas M. Sawyer was born in Hillsdale, Michigan, November 11, 1917. He is the descendent of two University of Michigan regents, Walter H. Sawyer and Austin E. Wing. After receiving a bachelor's degree in biology at Kenyon College (1939), Sawyer taught English in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where he experienced the Japanese attack. During World War II, Sawyer served as an ambulance driver in the American Field Service from 1943 to 1945. In 1945 Sawyer came back to Michigan and began a teaching career as a professor of humanities in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, while he worked toward a master's degree (1947) and a PhD (1953) in the field of speech. Professor Sawyer served as chairman of the College's Department of Humanities from 1966 to 1971. He retired from active teaching in 1986 and was later named professor emeritus of humanities by the Board of Regents.</p>
